    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-2.5lb Chuck Roast</li>
        <li>Small Bunch of Green Onion</li>
        <li>1 small-medium Shallot</li>
        <li>2 TBS – Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ Water or Favorite Grilling Liquid</li>
        <li>½ Cannabis-Infused BBQ Sauce</li>
        <li>Apple Cider Vinegar for Spritz</li>
        <li>2 TBS – Salt, Pepper, Garlic</li>
        <li>½ TBS – Smoked Paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set smoker to 225°</li>
        <li>If needed, tie your Chuck Roast to ensure consistent thickness throughout</li>
        <li>Mix all ingredients to make the rub and rub the meat liberally. You can use a binder such as mustard or just a light coating of oil to ensure the rub sticks to the roast</li>
        <li>Smoke directly on the grate for 2.5 – 3 hours or until internal temperature reaches 165-170 degrees, spritzing with 50/50 Apple Cider Vinegar and water/favorite grilling liquid every 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Then, place into a foil pan (or large hotel pan) with the onion, shallot, garlic, cannabis-infused BBQ sauce (made by following your favorite BBQ sauce recipe and substituting regular honey for canna-honey), and water/grilling liquid</li>
        <li>Cover tightly with foil and return to smoke</li>
        <li>Continue cooking at 225° degrees until internal temperature reaches 205°. Remove pan from heat and let rest for at least 30 minutes but recommend 1 hour to ensure the roast is tender</li>
    </ol>
