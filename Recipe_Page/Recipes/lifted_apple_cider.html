You have a few options with dosing this recipe– you can use an alcohol tincture, a glycerine tincture or even canna-honey to dose it. Included below is a recipe for the glycerine tincture, which has a sweet flavor and subtle effect that is very soothing for many people.</h4>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of apple cider, organic if possible</li>
        <li>4 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>4 star anise pods</li>
        <li>8 cloves</li>
        <li>1-inch chunk of ginger, optional</li>
        <li>2-4 tablespoons brown sugar or other sweetener (perhaps forgo this if dosing with glycerine or cannahoney)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of cannabis tincture-- alcohol tincture, glycerine tincture, or canna-honey Thinly sliced apples and lemons, oranges, or tangerines, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the apple cider in a 2-quart pot over medium heat with the spices and ginger, if using. When lightly simmering, turn down the heat to low and add sweetener, if using, and tincture or canna-honey. Stir to dissolve and let sit over the lowest heat for about 5-10 minutes</li>
        <li>Pour hot cider in to 12-ounce mugs and garnish each with one of the cinnamon sticks and one of the star anise pods, plus a slice of apple and lemon or other citrus. Enjoy!</li>
